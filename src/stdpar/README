This version of the code has ZERO OpenACC directives.

It requires Fortran 2023 standard as it uses "reduce" on 
do concurrent loops.

In order to run this on more than one GPU, you must launch it 
in a special way.

An example of a launch script to do this is below:


launch_script.sh
=======================================
#!/bin/bash
# Assume 1 GPU per MPI local rank
# Set device for this MPI rank:
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="$OMPI_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK"
# Execute code:
exec $*
=======================================

This script can then be launched using:
./launch_script.sh pot3d
