This version of the code has no directives other than device selection.

It requires Fortran 2023 standard as it uses "reduce" on 
do concurrent loops.

To make a "pure Fortran" version of the code, one can remove the two 
device selection directives.  If they are removed, in order to run
on more than one GPU, it must be launched in a special way.

An example of a launch script to do this is below:


launch_script.sh
=======================================
#!/bin/bash
# Assume 1 GPU per MPI local rank
# Set device for this MPI rank:
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="$OMPI_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK"
# Execute code:
exec $*
=======================================

This script can then be launched using:
./launch_script.sh pot3d
